Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
    use my_first_db


Create students collection.
    db.createCollection('students')

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
Get all students.
    db.students.find().pretty()
Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
    db.students.find({location: "California"}).pretty()
    
Get all students whose lucky number is:
greater than 3
    db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})
less than or equal to 10
    db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte:10}})
between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
    db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt:1 , $lte: 9}})
Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$set:{interests: ['coding', 'brunch', 'mongodb']} })
Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
    db.students.update({name: "Patrick"}, { $push: {interests: "football"}} )
Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
    db.students.update({name: "Bill}, {$push: {interests: 'taxes'}})
Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
    db.students.update({name: "Bill}, {$pull: {interests: 'taxes'}})
Remove all students who are from California (or Washington).
    db.students.remove({location: "California"})

Remove a student by name.
    db.students.remove({name: "Patrick"}, true)
    
    
Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
    db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)
Add a field to each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})
Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
    db.students.updateMany({location: "Washington"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts:1}})
Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {"number_of_belts":"belts_earned"}})
Remove the 'lucky_number' field.
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset:{lucky_number:""}})

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
    db.students.updateMany({}, {$currentDate: {updated_on:true}})
